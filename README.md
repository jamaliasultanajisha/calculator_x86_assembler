# calculator_x86_assembler
In this problem a calculator will be implemented with three simple operations: add (code: a), subtract (code: s), and 
multiplication (code: m). The inputs can be floating point numbers.
Any built in Floating point arithmetic operation is not used, i.e., use built in integer arithmetic operators to implement 
the operations. The results and inputs can be  both positive and negative. 
The inputs and the end result can be contained in a total of 9 digits (digits before the decimal point + digits after the 
decimal point. E.g., 3.457 has 4 digits, 3123.56789 has 9)

For example
====================================================
Welcome to Calculator v 1.0.
Press a to add, s to subtract and m to multiply.
Operation: a
Enter first number: 22.45
Enter second number: 3.5
The summation is: 25.95
Operation: s
Enter first number: 22.45
Enter second number: 3.3
The difference is: 19.15
Operation: m
Enter first number: 3.6
Enter second number: 2
Operation: 7.2
